# Estimation-of-Neonatal-Mortality-Rate-NMR-
The aim of this paper is to estimate the average neonatal mortality rate (NMR) by a linear regression analysis. This is of interest for we want to analyse the claim that the composition of child mortality has changed, where the under  5 mortality rate (U5MR) has declined globally over the decades (since 1950, when  our data starts) leading to a higher classification of child mortality as NMR.
